State of the art survey: 

It is reported that it is possible to discriminate between two points located
at least 0.5mm apart [9], [10].

Tactile systems classified into the following major categories, based
on the modality used:
- pressure (mechanical energy),
- vibration (mechanical energy),
- electric field,
- temperature (or thermal flow).

1. 
A refreshable Braille display (RBD) is an electro-mechanical device displays Braille characters
in a sequential way by raising and lowering pins through holes in a flat surface, in
response to an electronic signal.

In the paper "An innovative idea for low cost Braille e-reader" They use a 3d printed square that has braille letters printed on every side, and 
the sqaure is rotated to reveal the desired braille sequence. 

In the paper " Rotating-wheel braille display for continuous refreshable braille. " They use a wheel that the user places their finger against, and the 
wheel rotates to reveal braille characters

Pros: - A refreshable display is a similar idea to what we are trying to achieve, so we can take inspiration from it 

cons: - Technologies are all developed for braille 
	- it can be a difficult to place english letters on surfaces to have them rotate.

2. HamsaTouch ** There is only a youtube video, could not find the research paper. 

The system is composed of an electro-tactile display with 512 electrodes, the same number of optical sensors beneath each electrode, 
and a smartphone with a camera and an LCD. The smartphone acquires the surrounding view, conducts image processing and displays the image on the LCD screen. 
The image is captured by the optical sensors which activate the electrodes to create a tactile image.
